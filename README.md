## **Object Oriented Programming In JS**
---
-  In order to prepare big applications where we have a lot of data coming here and their, and you want to represent the logic in terms of frontend backend and whereever you are storing it we need to have some blueprinting mechanism. So that we can prepare a logical mental model.

- Once we have the blueprinting then we can start populating values to it and construct real life enities. This blueprinting paradigm is known as *Object oriented programming*.

- OOPs can be a bit different from programming language to programming language. Because there are sometimes language based restrictions

- In Javascript the OOPs is completely different maybe the keywords have similarities with other languages but the concept and the usage are different from them
